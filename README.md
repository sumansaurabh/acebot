Interview Corvus is an AI-powered invisible assistant designed specifically for technical coding interviews. Named after the corvid family of birds (crows, ravens) known for their exceptional intelligence, this application offers real-time coding solutions while remaining invisible during screen sharing sessions.

This open-source project was inspired by [interview-coder](https://github.com/ibttf/interview-coder) and extends the functionality with advanced features like screenshot analysis, multi-language support, and customizable AI prompts.

## Key Features

- **Invisible during screen sharing** - Hide the app instantly with hotkeys
- **AI-powered coding solutions** - Get complete solutions with detailed explanations
- **Time & space complexity analysis** - Understand the efficiency of your algorithms
- **Screenshot problem solving** - Capture coding problems directly from your screen
- **Multi-language support** - Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, Go, Rust, Ruby
- **Edge case handling** - Identify and address potential edge cases in your solutions
- **Optimization suggestions** - Improve your initial solutions with one click
- **Global hotkey controls** - Use the app even when it's not in focus

3. Take a screenshot of a coding problem using the appropriate hotkey for your platform
4. Generate a solution with another hotkey
5. Use the "Hide" button or hotkey to make the app invisible when needed

## Customizable Hotkeys

Interview Corvus allows you to customize all keyboard shortcuts according to your preference:

1. Open the application settings (click the "Settings" button or use the menu: File → Settings)
2. Navigate to the "Hotkeys" tab
3. Click on any hotkey field and press your desired key combination
4. Press "OK" to save your custom hotkeys

Default hotkeys by platform:

| Function | macOS | Windows |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Take Screenshot | Cmd+Ctrl+1 | Ctrl+Alt+1 |
| Generate Solution | Cmd+Ctrl+2 | Ctrl+Alt+2 |
| Toggle Visibility | Cmd+Ctrl+B | Ctrl+Alt+B |
| Move Window Up | Cmd+Up | Win+Up |
| Move Window Down | Cmd+Down | Win+Down |
| Move Window Left | Cmd+Left | Win+Left |
| Move Window Right | Cmd+Right | Win+Right |
| Optimize Solution | Cmd+Ctrl+O | Ctrl+Alt+O |
| Reset History | Cmd+Ctrl+R | Ctrl+Alt+R |
| Panic (Instantly Hide) | Cmd+Q | Alt+Q |

> **Note for Windows users:** The "Win" key refers to the Windows key (with the Windows logo) on your keyboard. On Linux systems, this is often called the "Super" key.

You can reset all hotkeys to their platform-specific defaults at any time using the "Reset All Hotkeys to Defaults" button in the settings.

## Required Permissions
