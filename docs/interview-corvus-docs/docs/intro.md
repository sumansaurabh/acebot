## What is Interview Corvus?

Interview Corvus is an intelligent coding assistant named after the corvid family of birds (crows, ravens) known for their exceptional intelligence. This application offers real-time coding solutions while remaining invisible during screen sharing sessions.

## Key Features

- **Invisible during screen sharing** - Hide the app instantly with hotkeys
- **AI-powered coding solutions** - Get complete solutions with detailed explanations
- **Time & space complexity analysis** - Understand the efficiency of your algorithms
- **Screenshot problem solving** - Capture coding problems directly from your screen
- **Multi-language support** - Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, Go, Rust, Ruby
- **Edge case handling** - Identify and address potential edge cases in your solutions
- **Optimization suggestions** - Improve your initial solutions with one click
- **Global hotkey controls** - Use the app even when it's not in focus
- **Web API support** - Access functionality through HTTP endpoints

## How It Works

1. **Capture** - Take a screenshot of a coding problem
2. **Analyze** - AI analyzes the problem and generates a solution
3. **Learn** - Review the solution, complexity analysis, and explanations
4. **Hide** - Make the app invisible when sharing your screen
5. **Code** - Implement the solution with confidence
