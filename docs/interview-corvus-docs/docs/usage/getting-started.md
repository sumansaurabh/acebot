# Getting Started

Learn how to use Interview Corvus effectively for technical coding interviews.

## First Steps

After installing and configuring Interview Corvus, you're ready to start solving coding problems!

### 1. Launch the Application

Start Interview Corvus from your Applications folder (macOS) or by running the executable (Windows).

### 2. Position the Window

- The window can be positioned anywhere on your screen
- Use **Window Opacity** settings to make it semi-transparent
- Enable **Always On Top** to keep it visible over other applications

### 3. Take a Screenshot

Capture a coding problem using the screenshot hotkey:

**Default Hotkeys:**
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Ctrl+1`
- **Windows**: `Ctrl+Alt+1`

The screenshot will be automatically analyzed by the AI.

### 4. Generate a Solution

Use the solution generation hotkey:

**Default Hotkeys:**
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Ctrl+2`
- **Windows**: `Ctrl+Alt+2`

The AI will generate:
- Complete code solution
- Algorithm explanation
- Time complexity analysis
- Space complexity analysis
- Edge case handling
- Detailed walkthrough

### 5. Review and Learn

Study the generated solution:
- Read the algorithm explanation
- Understand the complexity analysis
- Review edge cases
- Learn the optimization strategies

### 6. Optimize (Optional)

Want to improve the solution? Use the optimize hotkey:

**Default Hotkeys:**
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Ctrl+O`
- **Windows**: `Ctrl+Alt+O`

This will provide:
- Optimized code version
- Performance improvements
- Alternative approaches
- Trade-offs explanation

### 7. Hide When Needed

Before sharing your screen in an interview, hide the application:

**Quick Hide Hotkeys:**
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Ctrl+B` (toggle) or `Cmd+Q` (instant panic hide)
- **Windows**: `Ctrl+Alt+B` (toggle) or `Alt+Q` (instant panic hide)

## Basic Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow during an interview preparation session:

```
1. Open Interview Corvus
2. Navigate to a coding problem (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
3. Press Cmd+Ctrl+1 (macOS) to screenshot the problem
4. Press Cmd+Ctrl+2 to generate solution
5. Study the solution and complexity analysis
6. Press Cmd+Ctrl+O to see optimizations
7. Implement the solution in your IDE
8. Test with different inputs
9. Press Cmd+Ctrl+R to reset for next problem
```

## Understanding the Output

### Solution Format

Interview Corvus provides structured solutions:

**Problem Description**
- What the problem is asking
- Input/output format
- Constraints

**Algorithm Approach**
- High-level strategy
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Key insights

**Code Implementation**
- Complete, working code
- Comments explaining key parts
- Language-specific best practices

**Complexity Analysis**
- Time complexity with explanation
- Space complexity with explanation
- Why this complexity is achieved

**Edge Cases**
- Common edge cases to consider
- How the solution handles them
- Test cases to verify

### Programming Languages

Interview Corvus supports multiple languages:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Rust
- Ruby

Select your preferred language in Settings or before generating a solution.

## Tips for Best Results

### Taking Screenshots

For accurate problem recognition:
- ✅ Capture the entire problem statement
- ✅ Include constraints and examples
- ✅ Use clear, high-resolution screenshots
- ❌ Avoid partial screenshots
- ❌ Don't include unnecessary UI elements

### Using AI Solutions

Remember:
- **Understand, don't memorize** - Focus on learning the approach
- **Practice implementation** - Type the code yourself
- **Test thoroughly** - Run the solution with different inputs
- **Learn patterns** - Recognize common problem-solving patterns
- **Ask "why"** - Understand why this solution works

### Interview Best Practices

1. **Hide before screen sharing** - Always hide the app first
2. **Practice speaking** - Explain your thought process out loud
3. **Code manually** - Don't copy-paste, implement yourself
4. **Verify understanding** - Make sure you can explain the solution
5. **Handle follow-ups** - Be prepared to discuss optimizations

## Window Management

### Moving the Window

Use keyboard shortcuts to position the window:

**macOS:**
- `Cmd+Up` - Move window up
- `Cmd+Down` - Move window down
- `Cmd+Left` - Move window left
- `Cmd+Right` - Move window right

**Windows:**
- `Win+Up` - Move window up
- `Win+Down` - Move window down
- `Win+Left` - Move window left
- `Win+Right` - Move window right

### Opacity Control

Adjust window transparency in Settings:
- **0%** - Fully transparent (background visible)
- **50%** - Semi-transparent (good for overlays)
- **100%** - Fully opaque (default)

## Resetting and Managing History

### Clear Current Session

Reset the chat history and screenshots:

**Hotkeys:**
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Ctrl+R`
- **Windows**: `Ctrl+Alt+R`

### Manual Clear

Use the "Clear History" button in the UI to:
- Remove all screenshots
- Reset conversation context
- Start fresh with a new problem
