**Getting an API Key:**
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy and store securely

**Pricing Considerations:**
- GPT-4o: Higher quality, higher cost
- o3-mini: More cost-effective for simpler problems
- Monitor usage to control costs

### Anthropic Claude

**Available Models:**
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Excellent reasoning and explanation
- **Claude 3 Haiku** - Fast and efficient
- **Claude 3 Opus** - Most capable but slower

**Getting an API Key:**
1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Generate new key
5. Copy and secure

## Configuration Options

### Model Selection

**Choosing the Right Model:**

**For Beginners:**
- **o3-mini** or **Claude 3 Haiku** - Cost-effective learning
- Good for basic algorithm problems
- Faster response times

**For Advanced Users:**
- **GPT-4o** or **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Best performance
- Better for complex problems
- More detailed explanations

**For Cost Optimization:**
- Start with cheaper models
- Upgrade for difficult problems
- Monitor API usage regularly

### Temperature Settings

**Temperature Controls Creativity vs. Consistency:**

```
0.0 - 0.3: Very consistent, deterministic
0.3 - 0.7: Balanced approach (recommended)
0.7 - 1.0: More creative, varied solutions
1.0 - 2.0: Highly creative (may be inconsistent)
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Interviews: 0.3-0.5** - Reliable, consistent solutions
- **Learning: 0.5-0.7** - Variety in explanations
- **Exploration: 0.7-1.0** - Creative problem-solving approaches

### Advanced Configuration

**API Endpoints:**
- Usually auto-configured
- Custom endpoints for enterprise users
- Regional endpoint selection

**Request Timeouts:**
- Default: 30 seconds
- Increase for complex problems
- Decrease for faster feedback

**Rate Limiting:**
- Built-in request throttling
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Respect API provider limits

## Optimization Strategies

### Cost Management

**Monitor Usage:**
- Track API calls and costs
- Set up billing alerts
- Use cheaper models when appropriate

**Efficient Usage:**
- Take clear, complete screenshots
- Avoid repeated requests for same problem
- Use optimization feature sparingly

**Batch Operations:**
- Process multiple problems in sequence
- Cache common solutions
- Learn patterns to reduce API dependency

### Performance Optimization

**Response Time:**
- Choose faster models for time-sensitive situations
- Pre-warm API connections
- Use local caching when possible

**Quality Optimization:**
- Use higher-tier models for complex problems
- Adjust temperature based on problem type
- Provide clear, detailed screenshots

## Troubleshooting

### Common API Issues

**Authentication Errors:**
```
HTTP 401 Unauthorized
```
- Check API key validity
- Verify key permissions
- Ensure key is not expired

**Rate Limiting:**
```
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
```
- Wait before retrying
- Reduce request frequency
- Consider upgrading API plan

**Insufficient Credits:**
```
HTTP 402 Payment Required
```
- Check account balance
- Add payment method
- Purchase additional credits

### Connection Issues

**Network Problems:**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify firewall settings
- Try different network if possible

**API Outages:**
- Check provider status pages
- Have backup provider configured
- Wait for service restoration

### Quality Issues

**Poor Response Quality:**
- Improve screenshot clarity
- Include all problem constraints
- Adjust temperature settings
- Try different model

**Inconsistent Results:**
- Lower temperature setting
- Use more specific prompts
- Try multiple requests for comparison

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management

**Storage Security:**
- Never hardcode keys in source code
- Use secure system keychains
- Rotate keys periodically
- Monitor key usage

**Access Control:**
- Limit key permissions when possible
- Use separate keys for different environments
- Revoke unused keys immediately
- Monitor for unauthorized usage

### Data Privacy

**Screenshot Handling:**
- Images are sent to API providers
- Consider data sensitivity
- Review provider privacy policies
- Use local processing when possible

**Solution Storage:**
- Local storage by default
- Consider encryption for sensitive data
- Regular cleanup of old solutions
- Secure backup practices
