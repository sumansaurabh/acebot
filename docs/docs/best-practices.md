# Best Practices

Learn how to use Interview Corvus effectively and ethically in technical coding interviews.

## Pre-Interview Preparation

### Technical Setup

**System Configuration:**
1. **Install and test** Interview Corvus well before your interview
2. **Grant all necessary permissions** (Screen Recording, Accessibility)
3. **Test API connectivity** and ensure sufficient credits
4. **Verify hotkey functionality** across all features
5. **Practice the hide/show workflow** until it's instinctive

**Environment Setup:**
1. **Position your monitor** to have non-shared screen space
2. **Test screen sharing** with your interview platform
3. **Ensure stable internet** connection
4. **Close unnecessary applications** that might conflict
5. **Prepare your workspace** with minimal distractions

### Practice Routine

**Mock Interview Practice:**
1. **Solve problems** without assistance first
2. **Use Interview Corvus** as a backup/verification tool
3. **Practice explaining** solutions in your own words
4. **Time yourself** on various problem types
5. **Review and understand** all generated solutions

## During the Interview

### Stealth Operation

**Visibility Management:**
- **Pre-position** the app window in a non-shared area
- **Use transparency** settings to reduce visibility
- **Practice quick hide** with muscle memory hotkeys
- **Have panic hotkey** ready for emergencies
- **Test visibility** before screen sharing begins

**Smooth Workflow:**
1. **Listen carefully** to the problem statement
2. **Ask clarifying questions** before taking any screenshots
3. **Take screenshot** discretely when problem is clear
4. **Generate solution** using hotkey
5. **Study the solution** quickly but thoroughly
6. **Implement step by step** as if solving naturally

### Natural Implementation

**Acting Naturally:**
- **Don't copy-paste** solutions directly
- **Type at normal speed** with occasional pauses
- **Make minor modifications** to show personal style
- **Add comments** as you would normally
- **Think out loud** about your approach

**Handling Explanations:**
- **Understand the algorithm** before explaining
- **Use your own words** rather than generated explanations
- **Break down the approach** step by step
- **Discuss time/space complexity** confidently
- **Address follow-up questions** thoughtfully

## Ethical Usage Guidelines

### Responsible Use

**Primary Principles:**
- Use as a **learning aid** and **safety net**, not a primary solution
- **Understand every solution** before implementing
- **Build genuine skills** through practice and study
- **Be prepared** to solve similar problems independently
- **Maintain interview integrity** while using assistance

**Learning Focus:**
- **Study patterns** in generated solutions
- **Learn new algorithms** and data structures
- **Understand optimization** techniques
- **Practice explaining** complex concepts
- **Build problem-solving** intuition over time

### When to Use Interview Corvus

**Appropriate Situations:**
- **Blank mind moments** when you know the solution but can't recall
- **Verification** of your approach before implementing
- **Optimization ideas** after solving with a basic approach
- **Edge case identification** you might have missed
- **Complex algorithm** implementation details

**When NOT to Use:**
- **Every problem** - build genuine skills
- **Basic problems** you should know by heart
- **During verbal discussions** about approaches
- **When you have a clear solution** path already
- **As a substitute** for fundamental knowledge

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### Systematic Approach

**Problem Analysis:**
1. **Read carefully** and identify key requirements
2. **Identify pattern** or algorithm type
3. **Consider edge cases** and constraints
4. **Plan your approach** before coding
5. **Use Interview Corvus** for verification/backup

**Solution Development:**
1. **Start with brute force** if needed
2. **Optimize step by step** with guidance
3. **Test with examples** mentally
4. **Consider edge cases** and handle them
5. **Analyze complexity** and explain trade-offs

### Common Problem Types

**Array/String Problems:**
- Two pointers technique
- Sliding window patterns
- Hash map optimizations
- Dynamic programming approaches

**Tree/Graph Problems:**
- DFS/BFS traversals
- Path finding algorithms
- Tree construction patterns
- Graph connectivity problems

**Dynamic Programming:**
- State definition strategies
- Recursive to iterative conversion
- Space optimization techniques
- Common DP patterns

## Interview Communication

### Explaining Your Solution

**Structure Your Explanation:**
1. **Problem understanding** - restate the problem
2. **Approach overview** - high-level strategy
3. **Algorithm details** - step-by-step breakdown
4. **Complexity analysis** - time and space
5. **Edge cases** - special scenarios considered

**Communication Tips:**
- **Think out loud** during implementation
- **Explain trade-offs** between different approaches
- **Discuss optimization** opportunities
- **Handle questions** confidently
- **Admit limitations** honestly when needed

### Handling Follow-ups

**Common Follow-up Types:**
- **Optimization** requests
- **Edge case** discussions
- **Alternative approaches** exploration
- **Scalability** considerations
- **Real-world applications**

**Response Strategy:**
- **Use Interview Corvus** for quick verification
- **Think through** implications yourself first
- **Provide multiple** solution approaches when possible
- **Discuss practical** trade-offs
- **Show problem-solving** flexibility

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Mistakes

**Screenshot Issues:**
- **Partial screenshots** missing constraints
- **Poor quality** images affecting OCR
- **Wrong problem** captured
- **Multiple problems** in one screenshot

**Implementation Errors:**
- **Direct copying** without understanding
- **Unnatural typing** speed or patterns
- **Missing personal** coding style
- **Ignoring** interviewer questions while using tool

### Behavioral Red Flags

**Suspicious Behavior:**
- **Long pauses** with sudden perfect solutions
- **Overly complex** solutions for simple problems
- **Robotic explanations** using AI language
- **Inability to modify** or debug solutions
- **Perfect recall** of obscure algorithms
