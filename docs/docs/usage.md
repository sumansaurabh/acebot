# Usage Guide

Learn how to effectively use Interview Corvus to excel in your technical coding interviews.

## Basic Workflow

The typical workflow with Interview Corvus follows these steps:

1. **Setup** your API key and preferences
2. **Capture** the coding problem via screenshot
3. **Generate** an AI-powered solution
4. **Optimize** the solution if needed
5. **Hide** the app during screen sharing

## Initial Setup

### API Key Configuration

1. **Launch** Interview Corvus
2. **Click** the Settings button (or use File â†’ Settings)
3. **Select** your preferred API provider:
   - **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-4o, o3-mini)
   - **Anthropic** (Claude models)
4. **Enter** your API key
5. **Configure** additional settings like temperature and default language

### Theme and Display Settings

- **Theme**: Choose between Light and Dark themes
- **Window Opacity**: Adjust transparency (useful for overlay mode)
- **Always On Top**: Keep window visible above other applications
- **Default Language**: Set your preferred programming language

## Core Features

### Screenshot Problem Solving

**Taking Screenshots:**
- Use the hotkey (default: `Cmd+Ctrl+1` on macOS, `Ctrl+Alt+1` on Windows)
- The app will capture your screen and analyze the coding problem using OCR
- Ensure the entire problem statement and constraints are visible

**Best Practices for Screenshots:**
- Capture the complete problem including examples and constraints
- Ensure good contrast and readability
- Avoid partial screenshots that might miss important details

### Solution Generation

**Generating Solutions:**
- Use the hotkey (default: `Cmd+Ctrl+2` on macOS, `Ctrl+Alt+2` on Windows)
- The AI will provide a complete solution with detailed explanation
- Solutions include time and space complexity analysis
- Edge cases are automatically identified and addressed

**Solution Features:**
- **Complete Code**: Ready-to-use implementation
- **Explanation**: Step-by-step breakdown of the approach
- **Complexity Analysis**: Big O notation for time and space
- **Edge Cases**: Potential edge cases and how they're handled

### Solution Optimization

**Optimizing Existing Solutions:**
- Use the optimize hotkey (default: `Cmd+Ctrl+O` on macOS, `Ctrl+Alt+O` on Windows)
- The AI will suggest improvements to your current solution
- Get better time/space complexity where possible
- Learn alternative approaches and techniques

## Stealth Mode

### Invisible Operation

**Quick Hide:**
- Use the visibility toggle (default: `Cmd+Ctrl+B` on macOS, `Ctrl+Alt+B` on Windows)
- The app becomes completely invisible during screen sharing
- Essential for maintaining interview integrity

**Panic Mode:**
- Use the panic hotkey (default: `Cmd+Q` on macOS, `Alt+Q` on Windows)
- Instantly hides the application in emergency situations

**Window Management:**
- Move window with directional hotkeys
- Position the app in non-shared screen areas
- Use transparency settings for subtle operation

## Customization Options

### LLM Settings

**API Provider Selection:**
- Choose between OpenAI and Anthropic
- Select specific models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.)
- Adjust temperature for creativity vs. determinism (0.0-2.0)

**Model Recommendations:**
- **GPT-4o**: Best overall performance for coding problems
- **o3-mini**: Fast and efficient for simpler problems
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Excellent for detailed explanations

### Prompt Templates

Customize how the AI responds by modifying prompt templates:

- **Code Solution**: Customize solution generation behavior
- **Code Optimization**: Modify optimization strategies
- **Complexity Analysis**: Adjust complexity analysis format
- **Screenshot Solution**: Configure OCR and visual analysis parameters

### Programming Languages

Supported languages with optimized prompts:
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Rust
- Ruby

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Step Problem Solving

For complex problems:
1. **Break down** the problem using screenshot analysis
2. **Generate** initial solution
3. **Optimize** for better performance
4. **Test** edge cases mentally
5. **Prepare** explanations for the interviewer

### History Management

- **Reset History**: Clear all previous solutions (Cmd+Ctrl+R / Ctrl+Alt+R)
- **Review Solutions**: Access previously generated solutions
- **Learn Patterns**: Identify common problem types and solutions

## Best Practices

### During Interviews

1. **Pre-position** the app in a non-shared area
2. **Test hotkeys** before the interview starts
3. **Practice** the hide/show workflow
4. **Use wisely** - supplement your knowledge, don't replace it
5. **Stay calm** if something doesn't work as expected

### Effective Usage

1. **Read problems carefully** before taking screenshots
2. **Include all constraints** in your screenshots
3. **Review solutions** to understand the approach
4. **Practice explaining** the solutions in your own words
5. **Use optimization** to learn better approaches

### Ethical Considerations

- Use Interview Corvus as a **learning tool** and **safety net**
- **Understand** the solutions it provides
- **Be prepared** to explain your approach
- **Practice** without assistance to build genuine skills

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Solutions not generating:**
- Check API key and credits
- Verify screenshot clarity
- Ensure internet connection

**Hotkeys not working:**
- Check permission settings
- Verify hotkey conflicts
- Try customizing hotkeys

**App not hiding properly:**
- Ensure proper screen sharing software compatibility
- Test visibility toggle before interviews
